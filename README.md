## Problem

There are so many traffic violations and accidents happend in the road. Police officers record those in their books. Actually they are hand written recordings. So they are less in accuracy. And also in that moment police can't view other related violations done by the particular vehicle or driver.  In that case traffic officers identified that there can be lot of errors in data recordings. 

So that, our project owner, the police officer required us to implement a mobile application to enhance data entering to the system  with higher accuracy, update1rather than using hand written books.

This project is under Database for traffic violations. Police officers or authorized persons in traffic violation controlling are our targetted end users.
It is a mobile app, developed by using Android Studio with Java . It includes QR Scanner and Number Plate Recognition. 
In this app it is automatically opened mobile camera and can take vehicle number plate photo and recognition its details and realtime update the database.
Here we have used Firebase Database. This is developed by targetting newly issued driving licence, which has included QR code with driver details. 
In this app, it is scanned and all driver details are updated in the database.
And by entering NIC number of the driver, the police officer can retrieve data and find his previous traffic violations.
